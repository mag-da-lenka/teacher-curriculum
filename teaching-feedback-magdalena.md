Feedback from Magdalena Wojtakowska. A student at HYF that has worked as a teacher

## Preparation

- Do you plan? 
- How do you prepare? 
- Do you check in detail what it says in the lesson plan? 
- Do you know what you want to say/show/present? 
- Do you know how you want to say/show/present it? 
- Do you always remember most ss are total beginners? 
- Do you assume that when you start a new module, the previous ones have been executed 100%? 
- Do you assume that new concepts are intuitive to most people? 
- What do you think your role during the class is: 
  - to give a lecture and occassionally answer a question? 
  - only to guide and help having assumed that everyone is 100% prepared? 
  - involve ss in conversation? 
  - make them interact? [YES, but in a controlled way] 
  - other? ...

## During the lesson:

1. Clear goals: 
- Do you clearly say what they are and explain in a few sentences how you are going to execute the lesson plan? If you don't, why?

2. Timing: 
- Have you planned how much time you want to spend on each step? 
- Do you regularly check the time? 
- What would you do if you didn't manage to do all the exercises and explain all the theory?

3. Lesson plan on GitHub and how you execute it in class: 
- Do you stick to it? Why? Why not? 
- Do you improvise? Why /why not? 
- Do you think getting off the main subject might make the lesson more interesting (or would it generate confusion)? 
- Should you fully answer questions that are not exactly to the point? If not ---> you can send some links/.jsfiles /make a video after class (if you want).
- Should ss have the right to take over during the lesson? ---> No. You are in control. You know better and you have the right to stop the ss if they generate too much chaos. 
- Is the lesson proggressive when it comes to the level of difficulty? ---> If you stick to the plan on GitHub, it will be because the curriculum is great. :)
- Are you sure everything is done in baby steps? ---> How? (Baby steps: presentation/feedback/pres...) 
- Do you always wait for everyone to be ready with the task? Do you think you should? Why /why not? 
- If you don't manage to explain the theory and do the exercises because there was not enough time, do you provide the ss with solutions? 
- Do you always solve ALL the exercises? 
- Should the above be a priority?  
- Do you discuss what to do in homework before the class ends? (That helps a lot.) 
- Do you sum up the lesson? (Intro - MainBody:TheoryAndExercises - Conclusions)

4. Communication: 
- How do you communicate with ss? 
- How clear are your messages /instructions? 
- Do ss always know what to do? Can they navigate the lesson easily? 
- Do the ss know when to listen /do exercises /take notes? 
- Can everyone hear? Sure? Can everyone see? 
- Do the ss have time to digest the code while you're typing it? 
- Should they code along or just listen? 
- If you use the whiteboard: how do you assess your drawings? Are they beautiful and easy to understand?

5. Feedback from the ss: 
- Do you check regularly during the class that everything you say is clear? If so, how?
- Do you say 'is everything clear'/'are you following me'/'are you with me'/ etc? (If the ss don't answer clearly yes/no, do you move on?) 

6. Class notes/solutions/videos: 
- Are you sure you are recording the screen and that the audio is on? Can you double check? :)
- Do you send ss the code (from the lesson) on Slack?
- Is is easy to use or is half of it commented out so eg. when you activate all code, it will throw errors in the console? 
- If so, can you always rename your variables and functions so that you don't have to comment out the code inn the first place?  
- Do you think it makes sense to discuss homework when you see that some ss have'nt handed it in?
